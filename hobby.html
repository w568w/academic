                As a computer science student, I naturally have a keen interest in everything related to computers! I've been a computer enthusiast since around 2006 and began my programming journey approximately in 2014.

            <p>
                My first programming language was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Programming_Language">Easy Programming Language (易语言)</a>, a Chinese-syntax-based, VisualBasic-like <abbr title="Rapid Application Development">RAD</abbr> programming language for Windows applications. Following that foundation, I explored C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and more. Upon entering university, I started exploring newer programming languages. Currently, I've become an enthusiast of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, and <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>.
            </p>

                I'm a Windows devotee who has been consistently using the  system from Windows 2000 through 11 since 2006. However, my technological curiosity extends beyond; as an <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/account/w568w">Arch Linux advocate</a>, I've compiled <a href="https://github.com/w568w/alarm_repo">my own custom kernels</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w568w/u-boot-orangepi-3b">ported things across platforms</a>. I enjoy fixing things and learning how they work, which has led me to tinker with hardware, software, and firmware alike.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond programming, I'm a casual video gaming enthusiast with a diverse spectrum of interests: spanning <i>Minecraft</i>'s sandbox genre, RTS classics like <i>Red Alert 2</i>, racing franchises from <i>Need for Speed: Underground</i> to <i>Forza Horizon 5</i>, and triple-A masterpieces ranging from <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> to <i>Baldur's Gate 3</i>. I also play mobile games, spending some time on rhythm games like <a href="https://cytoid.io/"><i>Cytoid</i></a>, as well as gacha games like <i>Arknights</i> and <i>Wuthering Waves</i>.
